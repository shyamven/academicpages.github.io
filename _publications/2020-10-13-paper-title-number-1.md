# excerpt: 'A discrete-time delay (TD) technique in a baseband receiver array is disclosed for canceling wide modulated bandwidth spatial interference and reducing the Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC) dynamic range requirements. In particular, the discrete-time delay (TD) technique first aligns the interference using non-uniform sampled phases followed by uniform cancellation using a cancellation matrix, such as, for example, a Truncated Hadamard Transform implemented with antipodal binary coefficients.'
